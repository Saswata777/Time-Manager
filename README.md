# Time Management Web App

This is a Time Management Web App built using React JS. It offers three main sections to help you manage your time effectively:

## 1. Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Timer section is designed to help you stay focused and productive. It follows the popular Pomodoro Technique, which consists of working for a set period of time followed by short breaks. The components in this section are as follows:

- **Pomodoro (25 minutes):** This is the main work session where you can concentrate on a task for 25 minutes.
- **Short Break (5 minutes):** After completing a Pomodoro session, take a short 5-minute break to relax and recharge.
- **Long Break (15 minutes):** After completing a certain number of Pomodoro sessions, reward yourself with a longer 15-minute break.

You can also customize the duration of each session using the range buttons provided.

## 2. Timer
The Timer section allows you to set a countdown timer for a specific duration, up to a maximum of 60 minutes. It can be useful for setting reminders or timing activities that require a specific timeframe.

## 3. Stopwatch
The Stopwatch section lets you track the elapsed time for any activity. You can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch as needed.

## Highlights of this Project
- **React Router:** The app utilizes React Router for single-page navigation, allowing smooth transitions between different sections.
- **Circular Progress Bar:** The timer section incorporates a visually appealing circular progress bar to provide a visual representation of the time remaining.
- **useState and useEffect Hooks:** These hooks are extensively used to manage the state of the app and handle side effects such as updating the timer and triggering actions at specific intervals.
- **setInterval and clearInterval:** These functions are utilized to create timers and stop them when necessary, ensuring accurate time tracking.
